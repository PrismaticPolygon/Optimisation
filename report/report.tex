\section*{Question 3}

For this problem, $9$ variables are necessary. Each relates to the amount of paint of one colour (cyan $C$, magenta $M$, or yellow $Y$) used in the creation of paint of another colour (red $R$, green $G$, blue $B$, or black $K$), e.g. $C_K$ denotes the number of gallons of cyan ($C$) paint used in the production of black ($K$) paint. The objective function is therefore:

\begin{center}

$max \bigl( \frac{10 \cdot (Y_R + M_R)}{2} + \frac{15 \cdot (Y_G + C_G)}{2} + \frac{25 \cdot (M_B + C_B)}{2} + \frac{25 \cdot (C_K + M_K + Y_K)}{3}\bigr)$

\end{center}

Each term is the amount of paint of a certain colour produced multiplied by the value of a gallon of paint of that colour: $10$ for $R$, $15$ for $G$, $25$ for $B$, and $25$ for $K$. The following constraints capture the limited quantities of paint available: $11$ gallons of $Y$, $10$ of $C$, and $5$ of $M$:

\begin {center}

$Y_R + Y_G + Y_K <= 11$ \\
$C_G + C_B + C_K <= 10$ \\
$M_B + M_K +M_R <= 5$ \\

\end{center}

Also necessary are constraints maintaining the correct ratios of paints used:

\begin{center}

$Y_R == M_R$ \\
$Y_G == C_G$ \\
$M_B == C_B$ \\
$C_K == M_K == Y_K$ \\

\end{center}

These maintain the ratios for $R$, $G$, $B$, and $K$ paint. An optimal solution produces $2$ gallons of $C$ paint, $8$ gallons of $G$ paint, $2$ gallons of $B$ paint, and $3$ gallons of $K$ paint, for a total value of \textit{£}$220$.

\section*{Question 4}

\subsection*{Part A} 

This is a simple knapsack problem. Each variable $A, B, C, D, E, F$ is binary: whether or not the item was taken. This leads to the following function:

\begin{center}

$max (60A + 70B + 40C + 70D + 16E + 100F)$

\end{center}

in which the constants are the values (\textit{£}) of each item. The only constraint is equally simple: that the weight of the taken items does not exceed $20$kg:

\begin{center}

$6A + 7B + 4C + 9D + 3E + 8F <= 20$

\end{center}

in which the constants are the weights (\textit{kg}) of each item. An optimal solution is to take items $B$, $C$, and $F$, resulting in a total weight of $19$\textit{kg} and a total value of \textit{£}$210$.

\subsection*{Part B}

This part adds a new constraint:  that taking $C$ only makes sense if $D$ is also taken, but not vice versa. This can be elegantly expressed as:

\begin{center}

$D - C >= 0$

\end{center}

This condition is only unsatisfied if $D = 0$ and $C = 1$. With this constraint, an optimal solution is to take items $D$, $E$, and $F$, resulting in a total weight of $20$\textit{kg} and a total value of \textit{£}$186$.

\subsection*{Part C}

This part adds a further modification. It is now possible to exceed the $20$\textit{kg} limit, but with a penalty of \textit{£}$15$ for each \textit{kg} over. A new variable, $w$, is necessary. The objective function is modified to:

\begin{center}

$max (60A + 70B + 40C + 70D + 16E + 100F - 15w)$

\end{center}

to capture the cost of exceeding the weight limit. An additional constraint is also required:

\begin{center}

$w == 6A + 7B + 4C + 9D + 3E + 8F - 20$

\end{center}

to set $w$ to number of \textit{kg} over the weight limit the solution is.
An optimal solution is to take items $A$, $B$, and $F$, resulting in a total weight of $21$\textit{kg} and a total value of \textit{£}$215$.
